# Open Empires

Open Empires is an educational multi-player RTS engine which interfaces
with the Age of Empires II Trial assets and strives to be written in 15,000
lines of C99 or less, using only SDL2 as an external dependency.

## Dependencies

    Arch   : pacman -S sdl2 sdl2_net sdl2_ttf
    Ubuntu : apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-net-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev

## Building

    git clone https://github.com/glouw/openempires
    cd openempires
    make -C src

## Running

Once the trial version of Age of Empires 2 (the original, not the Conquerors!)
has been installed, you may test the client-server model with the test bash script:

    ./test.sh

Note that this test script runs netem which purposely emulates a
very laggy and lossy network. Change ENTROPY within test.sh to 0.1%
to set realistic playing conditions. For development,
set ENTROPY to 1.0% to stress test the networking engine more efficiently.

Otherwise, assuming everything is on localhost, first start the server
by specifying the server, port, and the number of users who will be playing:

    ./openempires --server --port 1234 --users 3

Keep note, that 3 users implies 2 human players, and 1 anti-cheat bot
who spectates the game and detects and restores out of syncs.

Second, start said 3 clients (you, on your computer, a friend on their computer,
and the anti-cheat bot on a computer you trust). Specify your window resolution
and installation data folder path:

    ./openempires --host localhost --port 1234 --xres 1440 --yres 900 --path "/path/to/data/folder"

From here on its the game you know and love. Some small tweaks have been added
to ease the control aspect:

    W A S D : pans the camera
    left shift + left click: selects multiple of the same unit
    left alt + Q W E R T ... Z X C V B: selects a building to place, or a unit command to execute.

## Structure

C source lives in src/ folder and is compilable by both C++11 and C11
compilers. C source is separated by typedefs, implemented with .[ch]
files. General purpose scripts may live in the top level.

Structs are passed by value such that functions calls modify no more than
one argument at a time. Link time optimization removes most of the heavy
function argument copying.

To simplify the lockstep engine, double and floating points are not used,
and the standard math library is not linked with the final binary.
