OPEN EMPIRES

    Open Empires is an educational multi-player RTS engine capable of interfacing
    with the Age of Empires II and The Conquerors art assets.

    Open Empires strives to be written in less than 15,000 lines of C99 using only
    SDL2 as an external dependency.

    Open Empires borrows elements from Starcraft2 and Rome 1: Total War.

DEPENDENCIES

    Arch   : pacman -S sdl2 sdl2_net sdl2_ttf
    Ubuntu : apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-net-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev

BUILDING

    git clone https://github.com/glouw/openempires
    cd openempires
    make -C src

RUNNING

    To test the client-server model, run:

        ./test.sh

    Note that this test script runs netem which purposely emulates a
    very laggy and lossy network. Change ENTROPY within test.sh to 0.1%
    to set realistic playing conditions. For development,
    set ENTROPY to 1.0% to stress test the networking engine more efficiently.

    Otherwise, assuming everything is on localhost, first start the server:

        ./openempires --server --port 1234

    Second, start the client by specifying your window resolution and
    installation data folder path:

        ./openempires --host localhost --port 1234 --xres 1440 --yres 900 \
            --path "/path/to/data/folder"

STRUCTURE

    C source lives in src/ folder and is compilable by both C++11 and C11
    compilers. C source is separated by typedefs, implemented with .[ch]
    files. General purpose scripts may live in the top level.

    Structs are passed by value such that functions calls modify no more than
    one argument at a time. Link time optimization removes most of the heavy
    function argument copying.

    To simplify the lockstep engine, double and floating points are not used,
    and the standard math library is not linked with the final binary.
